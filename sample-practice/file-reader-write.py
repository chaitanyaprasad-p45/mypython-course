Logic Explanation:
Read the Input File:

The script uses open() in read mode ('r') to read the contents of the input file.
readlines() reads the file line by line into a list, where each list element is a line from the file.
Count Lines:

The number of lines is simply the length of the list (len(content)).
Count Words:

Each line is split into words using line.split().
The total number of words is the sum of the lengths of these split lists.
Count Characters:

The len(line) function is applied to each line to count the characters, including spaces and newlines.
These counts are summed up for all lines.
Write to the Output File:

The open() function with write mode ('w') is used to create or overwrite the output file.
The program writes a formatted summary of the analysis to this file.
Error Handling:

If the input file doesnâ€™t exist, a FileNotFoundError is caught, and a friendly error message is displayed.
A generic Exception block catches unexpected errors.
How to Test This Script:
Create a text file named input.txt (or any other name you choose) with some sample text.
Update the input_file and output_file variables in the script with the respective file names.
Run the script. Check the contents of output.txt to see the analysis.
